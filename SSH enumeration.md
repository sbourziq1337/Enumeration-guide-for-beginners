## What is SSH?
------------------

[![Untitled](https://secybr.com/assets/img/pitcures/ssh/ssh.png)](https://secybr.com/assets/img/pitcures/ssh/ssh.png)

SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate (c.f http or hypertext transfer protocol, which is the protocol used to transfer hypertext such as web pages) and share data. An inherent feature of ssh is that the communication between the two computers is encrypted meaning that it is suitable for use on insecure networks.

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE               VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh                   OpenSSH4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)
```

The protocol works in the client-server model, which means that the connection is established by the SSH client connecting to the SSH server. The SSH client drives the connection setup process and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server. After the setup phase the SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption and hashing algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data that is exchanged between the client and server.

The figure below presents a simplified setup flow of a secure shell connection.

## *Default Configuration
----------------------------
* TheÂ [sshd_config](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd_config)Â file, responsible for the OpenSSH server, has only a few of the settings configured by default. However, the default configuration includes X11 forwarding, which contained a command injection vulnerability in version 7.2p1 of OpenSSH in 2016. Nevertheless, we do not need a GUI to manage our servers.

## Enumeration
---------------------
### *Identifying an FTP Server

You can useÂ `Nmap`Â to check if there's an SSH server on a target host like this:

```
nmap -p 22 X.X.X.X
```

### *Banner Grabbing

You can useÂ `Netcat`Â to find out what service is running and its version by looking at the welcome message it shows when you connect. This method is called Banner Grabbing.

```
nc -vn X.X.X.X 22
```

### *Automated audit with ssh-audit

"ssh-audit" is a tool for analyzing SSH connections, providing details on banners, OS/software recognition, compression detection, algorithm information and security recommendations.

```
ssh-audit X.X.X.X 22
```

Â [ssh-audit](https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit). It checks the client-side and server-side configuration and shows some general information and which encryption algorithms are still used by the client and server. Of course, this could be exploited by attacking the server or client at the cryptic level later.

### Identify Authentication Methods with Nmap

`ssh-auth-methods`Â is an Nmap script used to identify the authentication methods supported by an SSH server.

```
nmap --script ssh-auth-methods --script-args="ssh.user=username" -p 22 X.X.X.X
```
### SSH Connection Tools
-------------------------------
Linux & Mac
```
1. ssh username@10.10.x.x #If ssh is running on another port, the -p parameter should be used.
2. #IPv6:
3. ssh username@fe80::b0ec:afd2:a932:252c%9
```

Windows:

- Putty
- Filezilla
- Winscp

## *Rsync
----------
[Rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync)Â is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts. It is highly versatile and well-known for its delta-transfer algorithm. This algorithm reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host. It does this by sending only the differences between the source files and the older version of the files that reside on the destination server. It is often used for backups and mirroring. It finds files that need to be transferred by looking at files that have changed in size or the last modified time. By default, it uses portÂ `873`Â and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking on top of an established SSH server connection.

owever, the misconfiguration of this utility can lead to an easy foothold for attackers to compromise the service. An attacker can look for weak configurations like anonymous access and write permissions to gain unauthorized access to the running server.

Thatâ€™s what we are going to do today ðŸ˜ˆ. We will take advantage of an insecureÂ **Rsync**Â service and obtain a shell with SSH. Learn how to perform [[Rsync enumeration]].
