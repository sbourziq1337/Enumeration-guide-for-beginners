# **What is NFS?**
---------------------------------------------------
**NFS (Network File System)** is a protocol that provides shared file system services on a computer network. NFS allows a server to share directories and files, which can then be mounted on client machines over the network.

NFS operates on a server-client model, where the server shares file systems and clients can use these shared files.
### *Versions

| **Version** | **Features**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NFSv2`     | It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `NFSv3`     | It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.                                                                                                                                       |
| `NFSv4`     | It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol. |
## *Default Configuration
------------------------------------------
NFS is not difficult to configure because there are not as many options as FTP or SMB have. The `/etc/exports` file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients. The [NFS Exports Table](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/exports.5.html) shows which options it accepts and thus indicates which options are available to us.
#### Exports File
-----------------

```shell-session
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

# Enumeration
------------------------------------------
NFS enumeration involves identifying NFS shares and their associated permissions, as well as identifying other systems on the network that may be vulnerable to NFS-based attacks.

The results of a complete port scan using [_Nmap_](https://nmap.org/book/) reveal that the target system is running NFS.

> The command below can be used to perform a comprehensive scan on the target.
	
	 -nmap -sC -sV -p- {TARGET_IP}  
	 >> -sC : runs the default set of NSE scripts.  
	-sV : performs version detection on open ports.  
	 -p- : scan all 65,535 ports.

* The `rpcinfo` NSE script retrieves a list of all currently running RPC services, their names and descriptions, and the ports they use. This lets us check whether the target share is connected to the network on all required ports. Also, for NFS, Nmap has some NSE scripts that can be used for the scans. These can then show us, for example, the `contents` of the share and its `stats`.

* Once we have discovered such an NFS service, we can mount it on our local machine. For this, we can create a new empty folder to which the NFS share will be mounted. Once mounted, we can navigate it and view the contents just like our local system.

#### Show Available NFS Shares
* A command line utility _“_[_showmount_](https://linux.die.net/man/8/showmount)_”_ can be used for this purpose which can interact and fetch a list of remote file systems which are exported by the target and are available for mounting.

> * The command below can be used to get the list of remote file systems which can be mounted.

```shell-session
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ showmount -e 10.129.14.128

Export list for 10.129.14.128:
/mnt/nfs 10.129.14.0/24
```

| **Command**                                               | **Description**                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `showmount -e <FQDN/IP>`                                  | Show available NFS shares.                   |
| `mount -t nfs <FQDN/IP>:/<share> ./target-NFS/ -o nolock` | Mount the specific NFS share to ./target-NFS |
| `umount ./target-NFS`                                     | Unmount the specific NFS share.              |

# **Mounting NFS shares**
----------------------------------------

* Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create .
* this folder anywhere on your system. Once you’ve created this mount point, you can use the “mount” command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:

```
sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock
```

```shell-session
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ mkdir target-NFS
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ cd target-NFS
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ tree .

.
└── mnt
    └── nfs
        ├── id_rsa
        ├── id_rsa.pub
        └── nfs.share

2 directories, 3 files
```

There we will have the opportunity to access the rights and the usernames and groups to whom the shown and viewable files belong. Because once we have the usernames, group names, UIDs, and GUIDs, we can create them on our system and adapt them to the NFS share to view and modify the files.
#### list Contents with Usernames & Group Names

```shell-session
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ ls -l mnt/nfs/

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3 1872 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3  348 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     1872 Sep 19 17:27 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      348 Sep 19 17:28 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root        0 Sep 19 17:22 nfs.share
```

#### List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs

```shell-session
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ ls -n mnt/nfs/

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1872 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000  348 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1    0 1000 1221 Sep 19 18:21 backup.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0 1872 Sep 19 17:27 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0  348 Sep 19 17:28 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0    0 Sep 19 17:22 nfs.share
```

It is important to note that if the `root_squash` option is set, we cannot edit the `backup.sh` file even as `root`.

We can also use NFS for further escalation. For example, if we have access to the system via SSH and want to read files from another folder that a specific user can read, we would need to upload a shell to the NFS share that has the `SUID` of that user and then run the shell via the SSH user.

After we have done all the necessary steps and obtained the information we need, we can unmount the NFS share.
#### Unmounting

```shell-session
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ cd ..
akerashadow@htb[/htb]$ sudo umount ./target-NFS
```
